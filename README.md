## Advanced workshop on XGBoost 

Tianqi Chen will be in Santa Monica, June 2, 2016 and besides a 
[meetup talk in the evening](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/xgboost-a-scalable-tree-boosting-system-tickets-25443090970) 
(already sold out, sorry)
I'm also organizing an advanced workshop in the afternoon (3:00-6:00pm) to do more advanced stuff.
There will be only 10 spots for the workshop and you'll have to 
[apply by filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14rlZFGKBOblu-ynuHp3ev-wrhZqSHQpiHeyjuaVKqN4/viewform?edit_requested=true) (Update: workshop is full.).

The workshop will be a mix of Tianqi talking about more advanced stuff and participants interacting, asking questions etc. (partly hands-on, bring your laptop and your specific questions/problems/datasets). We can use this github repo (issues, PR) for setting up questions/problems/topics etc. to be discussed in the workshop, feel free to participate.  

Schedule: 
- 3:00-3:15 Arrival 
- 3:15-3:30 Networking, Intro 
- 3:30-4:30 Session 1 
- 4:30-4:45 Break (coffee/cookies) 
- 4:45-5:45 Session 2 
- 5:45-6:15 Networking 

Location disclosed only to the selected participants.

If you have been selected for the workshop, then before coming, 
read the xgboost paper on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754), 
check out the suggested topics in the 
[GH issues](https://github.com/szilard/xgboost-adv-workshop-LA/issues) 
and take a look at some sample code in this repo.
